# Black ops II Riotshield Bounces
With the new update of Plutonium there is the possibility to activate the normal bounces but the riotshield bounces cannot be activated.
So I created a **Drag and Drop** script, just insert this script in your **gametypes** folder and *automatically you will have the riotshiled bounces working.*

**How to use it?**
1. Download the **_shellsock.gsc**
2. Drag and drop the file into your **gametypes** folder
